# Checkpoint Processing & Recovery (CPR)
- Coarse-grain retirement and aggressive register recclamation
- Checkpoint-based recovery from misprediction and interrupts, including rolling back prior to offending instruction (guaranteering forward progess)
- Confidence-based checkpoint placement

Guided by a project from ECE721 at NC State University taught by Prof. [Eric Rotenberg](https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/ericro/).
